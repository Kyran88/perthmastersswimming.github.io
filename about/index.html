<h1>Perth Masters Swimming Club</h1>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Welcome to Perth Masters</p>

<p>We are a friendly masters swimming club based in Perth, Scotland and are affiliated to the Scottish Amatuer Swimming Association.</p>

<p>Our members vary in age, but all have a desire to have fun and keep fit through swimming.</p>

<p>There are various masters swimming competitions throughout the year in different parts of the country and although very few of our members compete, encouragement is given to those who wish to do so.</p>

<p>As we are a friendly bunch, we try to have a few social events each year.</p>
<p>click the menu on the left to find out more.</p>
